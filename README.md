# Automatic Differentiation (AutoGrad)

A **custom implementation** of the **automatic differentiation** mechanism in **Python** reflecting usage patterns found in **common deep learning frameworks**. It is a **simplified** version that primarily demonstrates the implementation of **automatic differentation** and **backpropagation mechanism**.

The project structure has been **inspired** by the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) libraries.
